                <h1>Top 5 favorite video game soundtracks!</h1>
                <p>This is a list of my top five favorite video game OST's. The criteria for a game to be eligable are the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The music is judged in modern context, regardless of the date of release. Any songs on weaker hardware will not be judged on how good I think it was for it's time.</li>
                    <li>Songs must be original, with a few exceptions. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Remixes are only allowed if it is a remix of a song from a game in the same series, meaning Smash Ultimate is not elidgable, but Pokemon Remakes are. Spinoffs will count as "same series," even if it isn't made by the same developer.</li>
                            <li>Songs that contain pieces of other music without being remixes are elidgable</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If these requirements are not met, the game cannot be on the list, but can be an honorable mention</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>#5: Pokemon Omega Ruby &amp; Alpha Saphire</h2>
                <p>Pokemon games almost always have amazing soundtracks. Regardless of the quality of the games, the soundtracks are almost always excellent, consistently containing multiple songs that contend for a spot on my favorites list. Out of all Pokemon games though, it is my opinion that Omega Ruby &amp; Alpha Saphire has the highest quantity of amazing tracks. To name a few...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>vs. Primal Groudon/Primal Kyogre</li>
                    <li>vs. Zinnia</li>
                    <li>vs. Wally</li>
                    <li>vs. Rival</li>
                    <li>Littleroot Town</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>#4: Cadence of Hyrule</h2>
                <h2>#3: Undertale</h2>
                <h2>#2: Sonic Mania</h2>
