                <h1>Did You Know...</h1>
                <h3>Kazuya can cancel down-tilt</h3>
                <p>Kazuya's down tile (the one where you don't crouch) can be canceled with sheild before the hitbox comes out. You have almost no endlag when doing this, so you can fake a down-tilt to get your opponent to jump, then up-smash.</p>

                <h3>Yoshi's crafted world for 1$</h3>
                <p>Target had an issue internally causing Yoshi's crafted word, a $59.99 video game, to be sold at just $1! Target fixed this in under an hour and disabled codes for everyone who bought them, but people who already downloaded the game got to keep it.</p>

                <h3>Some buttons make different noises when you open the switch?</h3>
                <p>When opening the switch, you have to push any button 3 times in a row, and it makes a click sound. If you use ZL, ZR, the left stick, or the right stick to open the switch, it will make some fun sounds. Neat right?</p>
