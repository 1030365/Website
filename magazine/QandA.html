                <h1>Q&A with an aspiring game developer<sup>*</sup></h1>
                <p>The following is an interview with an aspiring game developer who wants to work for Nintendo someday.</p>
                <h2>INTERVIEW:</h2>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Q: What makes you want to work at Nintendo as opposed to other companies?</li>
                    <li>A: There are a few reasons, the first being that my favorite games are Nintendo IPs. Secondly, without naming names, I want to avoid companies that promote crunch culture. A lot of video game companies do it, but Nintendo is known to avoid it.</li>
                    <li>Q: What are your favorite games?</li>
                    <li>A: There are quite a few I'd like to mention; Minecraft has had the most impact on my life. I think that game is expertly designed to help kids discover what they like, and it did exactly that for me. I likely wouldn't be on a programming path without that game. Some other games I love are Terraria, Undertale, Super Smash Bros Ultimate, and Beatsaber. My favorite game is <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>.</li>
                    <li>Q: What game do you think has the best soundtrack?</li>
                    <li>A: There are a lot of games with soundtracks I love. To name some of my favorites, Sonic Mania, Undertale, Ori and the Blind Forest, Cadence of Hyrule, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, but the video game I think has the best soundtrack is Terraria.</li>
                    <li>Q: Last question, what games do you hope to play soon?</li>
                    <li>A: For me, the games currently out that I'd like to play soon are Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Sonic Colors Ultimate, WarioWare: get it Together, Metroid Dread, and the Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword.</li>
