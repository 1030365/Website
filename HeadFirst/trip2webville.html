                <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
                <dl>
                    <dt>What solution are we using to the problem presented in the chapter of <q>finding yourself a hosting company</q>?</dt>
                    <dd>Our class is using github to host our websites currently, though it wasn't always that way.</dd>
                    <dt>What are the advantages and disadvantages of our solution?</dt>
                    <dd>github wasn't designed to be a go-to web hosting server, meaning we don't have full control over domain names and <q>goodies</q> are limited. On the other hand though, uploading files is simple, reliable, and free!</dd>
                    <dt>What alternatives could we have used, and which alternative did we use earlier in the year?</dt>
                    <dd>We could have used SiteGround, DreamHost, GoDaddy, or other hosting companies, however being free is probably the most important factor for our class given that we aren't master professional web designers at the moment. Earlier in the year we used the students.gctaa.net server, and I forget why we switched, but I will say personally github is a lot more conveinent than the student server ever was.</dd>
                    <dt>A few of our enterprising classmates have taken the initiative to register their own domain name. See if you can find these classmates and ask them how they did it.</dt>
                    <dd>I hadn't read this part at the beginning of the week, but I was in the room listening to him when he was shopping around for one. He was on different websites that sold domain names and read through there selections, trying to find one suited to his desires and budget.</dd>
                    <dt>What is the process involved?</dt>
                    <dd>I also did some of my own research for this, in order to get a domain name, here's one way to go about it:
                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>Decide a domain name you want for your site.</li>
                            <li>Shop around multiple sites to find the best deal for your domain name or a similar domain name. Often the web hosting servers will also offer domain names. Additionally, domain availability checker tools exist which can aid in the search.</li>
                            <li>Complete the transaction (usually domains are purchasable through the site they are found on).</li>
                            <li>Verify the domain name (you may get an email after your purchase asking you to do this).</li>
                        </ol>
                    </dd>
                </dl>
