		<h1>Block-level Elements</h1>
		<h2>Text in a Preformatted Element</h2>
		<pre>This             text

        spans              several
   lines

                     and             has             lots
  of         extra              

whitespace.</pre>
		<p>The text above shows a paragraph that has so much space between words that you could drive a truck through it.</p>
		<h2>Same Text in a Paragraph Element</h2>
		<p>This             text

        spans              several
   lines

                     and             has             lots
  of         extra              

  whitespace.</p>
		<p>The text is now clearly lying because the text now shows up in a normal looking sentence.</p>
		<h2>Random Text</h2>
		<div>
			<p>When rolling two six sided die, you have a 1/6 chance of rolling a 7, which is the number you have the highest chance of rolling.</p>
			<p>When rolling 2 six sided die, you have a much higher chance of rolling numbers near the median as well as lower odds of rolling incredibly high or low outliers.</p>
		</div>
		<p>I notice no difference here from the normal paragraphs.</p>
