                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Q: What makes you want to work at Nintendo as opposed to other companies?</li>
                    <li>A: There are a few reasons, the first being that my favorite games are Nintendo IPs. Secondly, without naming names, I want to avoid companies that promote crunch culture. A lot of video game companies do it, but Nintendo is known to avoid it.</li>
