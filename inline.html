		<h1>Inline Elements</h1>
		<p>The first inline element to show off is the <strong>strong</strong> element, which is a less extreme version of the <b>bold</b> element. You can also make <i>italic</i> elements, but if you want a less extreme version, try using <em>emphasis</em> elements.</p>
		<p><q>I will shred this universe down to its last atom, then, with the stones you've collected for me, create a new universe that knows not what it has lost but only what it has been given.</q><br> - Thanos, 2019</p>
		<p>There also exist <code>code elements</code>. For keyboard input text, use <kbd>kbd elements</kbd>. Sub/super-script elements also exist, x<sub>1</sub> = 2a<sup>2</sup></p>
		<p>Oh yeah, <span>span elements</span> also exist.</p>
		<p>I think.</p>
		<p>I can't really tell though, the words I put in it look identical to all the other words, so who knows.</p>
